## Frontend Tech Challenge

The project is broken into five parts, each with a feature and a wireframe.

> The goal of this assessment is to replicate the frontend application below as close as possible. You are allowed to use any frontend framework (React.js, Vue.js, etc.) or use plain Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

I have chosen to use React as my framework and utilize other technologies like Redux and Tailwind CSS.

The [project board](https://github.com/users/andrewvallejo/projects/2/views/1?visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C%22Status%22%2C%22Labels%22%2C%22Repository%22%2C%22Assignees%22%5D) is where I organized all of my issues and objectives for my application. The **User Stories** drop-down is a high-level overview of what was required for the assignment.

- As a user, when I navigate to **website** in the application, I should see a list of GitHub issues for that repo, a portal with a list of robots, two search bars for name and tags, and a way to expand the robot's information
- I should be able to scroll inside of the portal to see all robots
    - I should be able to see a picture, a name, email, company, skills, and average of each robot
- I should be able to filter by name
- I should be able to filter by tags
- I should be able to filter by both names and tags
- I should be able to add tags to any robot
- I should be able to click on the plus sign to see more info
    - It should turn into a minus sign when active
    - I should be able to see all eight tests & test scores for each robot when expanded
- I should be able to click on the minus sign for less info
    - It should turn into a minus sign when active
